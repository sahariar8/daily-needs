## How Gitignore working
  - such as i have a.txt. b.py and .pdf i want to only push b.py in github

### To ignore specific files, such as a.txt, generate-236398-4fcb2a99-3863-4c8c-9ec5-5b3a7fab969c (6).pdf, and .gitignore while pushing b.py to GitHub, you can add these filenames to the .gitignore file. Here's how you can do it:
 1. Open or create the .gitignore file in the root directory of your Git repository.
 2. Add the filenames you want to ignore to the .gitignore file, each on a separate line:
     ```
       a.txt
       generate-236398-4fcb2a99-3863-4c8c-9ec5-5b3a7fab969c (6).pdf
       .gitignore
     ```
